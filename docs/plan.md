## Phase 1: Foundation & Security (Critical Priority)

### 1.1 Security & Configuration Hardening

**Rationale**: Security vulnerabilities and configuration issues pose immediate risks to application integrity and user data. These must be addressed before any feature development.

#### Immediate Actions
1. **Done**

2. **Implement API Security Layer**
   - Current: API endpoints lack authentication and authorization
   - Risk: Unauthorized access to user data and system functions
   - Solution: Add middleware for auth checks, rate limiting, and input validation
   - Timeline: Week 1-2

3. **Add Input Validation Framework**
   - Current: No validation on API requests
   - Risk: SQL injection, XSS, data corruption
   - Solution: Implement Zod schemas for all API endpoints
   - Timeline: Week 2

4. **Environment Variable Validation**
   - Current: No validation of required environment variables
   - Risk: Silent failures in production environments
   - Solution: Add startup validation for all required environment variables
   - Timeline: Week 1

### 1.2 Data Integrity & Performance

**Rationale**: Current data handling patterns create performance bottlenecks and potential data inconsistencies that will compound as the application scales.

#### Core Improvements
1. **Fix Supabase Client Architecture**
   - Current: New client instance created per API request
   - Problem: Inefficient connection handling, potential memory leaks
   - Solution: Implement singleton pattern with proper connection pooling
   - Timeline: Week 2

2. **Implement Proper State Management**
   - Current: Direct state mutations in components
   - Problem: Unpredictable state changes, difficult debugging
   - Solution: Enforce store actions for all state mutations
   - Timeline: Week 2-3

3. **Move Data Aggregation to Database**
   - Current: Client-side JavaScript calculations for play counts
   - Problem: Inefficient, unreliable, not scalable
   - Solution: Implement SQL aggregation queries in Supabase
   - Timeline: Week 3

---

## Phase 2: Architecture & Code Quality (High Priority)

### 2.1 Component Architecture Modernization

**Rationale**: Current component structure lacks modularity and reusability, making maintenance difficult and features hard to extend. A well-structured component architecture is essential for long-term maintainability.

#### Component Restructuring
1. **Layout Decomposition**
   - Current: Monolithic `layouts/default.vue` with mixed concerns
   - Problem: Hard to maintain, test, and extend
   - Solution: Extract into focused composables:
     - `useProfileManager()` - User profile logic
     - `useSearchHandler()` - Search functionality
     - `useSidebarManager()` - Navigation and sidebar state
     - `useNotifications()` - User feedback system
   - Timeline: Week 4-5

2. **Player Component Modularization**
   - Current: Large MiniPlayer component with multiple responsibilities
   - Problem: Difficult to test individual features, poor separation of concerns
   - Solution: Create specialized components:
     - `TrackInfo.vue` - Display current track metadata
     - `PlayerControls.vue` - Play/pause/skip functionality
     - `VolumeControl.vue` - Volume management
     - `ProgressBar.vue` - Track progress and seeking
   - Timeline: Week 5-6

3. **Reusable Component Library**
   - Current: Repeated UI patterns throughout the application
   - Problem: Inconsistent styling, duplicated code, hard to maintain
   - Solution: Create design system components:
     - `TrackCard.vue` - Standardized track display component
     - `LoadingSpinner.vue` - Consistent loading indicators
     - `ErrorBoundary.vue` - Graceful error handling
   - Timeline: Week 6-7

### 2.2 TypeScript Integration & Type Safety

**Rationale**: Strong typing improves code reliability, enables better IDE support, and catches errors at compile time rather than runtime.

#### Type System Implementation
1. **Comprehensive Interface Definitions**
   - Current: Minimal TypeScript interfaces
   - Solution: Define interfaces for all data structures:
     - User, Track, Playlist, Album entities
     - API request/response types
     - Component prop and event types
     - Store state and action types
   - Timeline: Week 7-8

2. **Generic Composables**
   - Current: Loosely typed composables
   - Solution: Implement generic types for reusable logic:
     - `useAsyncData<T>()` - Type-safe data fetching
     - `useCollection<T>()` - Generic collection management
     - `useForm<T>()` - Type-safe form handling
   - Timeline: Week 8

### 2.3 Code Quality & Standards

**Rationale**: Consistent code quality standards improve maintainability, reduce bugs, and enable team collaboration.

#### Quality Improvements
1. **Dependency Management**
   - Current: Duplicate draggable libraries (vue-draggable-next, vuedraggable)
   - Problem: Bundle bloat, potential conflicts
   - Solution: Standardize on single draggable library, audit all dependencies
   - Timeline: Week 3

2. **Internationalization Preparation**
   - Current: Hardcoded Russian text in codebase
   - Problem: Poor user experience for international users
   - Solution: Replace all hardcoded strings with i18n keys
   - Timeline: Week 9

3. **Project Identity**
   - Current: Generic "nuxt-app" package name
   - Problem: Poor project identity and SEO
   - Solution: Update package.json and all references to "swagmusic"
   - Timeline: Week 3

     - Spacing and sizing consistency
     - Animation and transition standards
   - Timeline: Week 12-13

3. **Component Styling Standards**
   - Current: Mix of UButton and custom button styles
   - Problem: Inconsistent user interface
   - Solution: Standardize on Nuxt UI components with custom theme
   - Timeline: Week 13

   - Solution: Implement real-time subscriptions for:
     - Playlist changes when shared with others
     - New track additions to followed playlists
     - User activity and presence indicators
   - Timeline: Week 17

2. **Offline Support**
   - Current: No offline functionality
   - Solution: Implement service worker for:
     - Offline track metadata access
     - Cached playlist browsing
     - Queue management without internet
   - Timeline: Week 18
